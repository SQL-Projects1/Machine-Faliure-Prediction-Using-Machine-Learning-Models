# Machine-Faliure-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning-Models
Project Overview: Machine Failure Prediction using Machine Learning

This project aims to predict machine failures using a machine learning model. It uses a RandomForestClassifier trained on a dataset containing various features such as footfall, temperature, air quality, and sensor readings. The project follows these key steps:

Data Loading: Loads the dataset from a CSV file named '/content/data .csv' into a pandas DataFrame.
Data Preparation: Separates the dataset into features (X) and target (y), representing the machine failure status. The features used are 'footfall', 'tempMode', 'AQ', 'USS', 'CS', 'VOC', 'RP', 'IP', and 'Temperature'.
Data Splitting: Splits the data into training and testing sets using train_test_split to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.
Model Training: Trains a RandomForestClassifier model using the training data to learn patterns and relationships between features and machine failures.
Prediction: Uses the trained model to predict machine failures on the testing data and new data provided.
Evaluation: Evaluates the model's accuracy by comparing its predictions to the actual failure status in the testing data.
Deployment: Provides a function test_model that takes input values for the features and returns the predicted failure status along with a message (Failure or NO Failure).
Key Deliverables:

A trained machine learning model for predicting machine failures.
A Python function (test_model) for making predictions on new data.
Evaluation metrics (accuracy) to assess the model's performance.
Potential Limitations or Roadblocks:

Model accuracy may be limited by the quality and quantity of the training data.
The model's performance may degrade over time if the underlying data distribution changes.
Interpretability of the model's predictions may be challenging due to the complex nature of RandomForestClassifier.
